- Run `python build_examples.py` to build generated files in all groups.
- Run `python build_examples.py compare` to compare generated files in all groups against the last commit.
- Run `python build_examples.py clean` to delete generated files in all groups.
- Run `python build_examples.py restore` to restore generated files in all groups from the last commit.
- Append `-c` or `--compare-graphviz-output` to the `compare` command above to also compare the Graphviz output (default: False).
- Append `-g` or `--groups` followed by space separated group names to any command above, and the set of generated files affected by the command will be limited to the selected groups.
- Run `python build_examples.py -h` or with `--help` to see a summary of the usage help text.
